# 👕 MERN Fashion E-Commerce Platform

A full-stack fashion e-commerce platform built as part of the **ShopMyUniform Internship Final Technical Assessment**.

The application enables users to browse products, search and filter items, manage a wishlist and shopping cart, place orders, and track their order status. It also includes a dedicated admin panel for managing products, categories, inventory, and customer orders.

The project is built using the **MERN Stack** with JWT Authentication, MongoDB Atlas, Cloudinary image storage, Razorpay integration, and a fully responsive user interface.

## Why MERN?

The MERN stack was chosen because it provides a complete JavaScript-based full-stack development experience. MongoDB offers flexible document-based storage, Express.js and Node.js provide a scalable backend API, while React with Vite delivers a fast and responsive frontend. Using JavaScript across the entire stack simplifies development and improves maintainability.

# 🤖 AI Usage

AI tools (primarily ChatGPT) were used as a development assistant for debugging, documentation, implementation guidance, code reviews, and improving development productivity.
All application architecture, feature integration, debugging, testing, and final implementation are fully understood by me. I am able to explain the complete codebase, design decisions, and implementation details during a live technical walkthrough.

---

# ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Product reviews and ratings are not implemented.
- Coupon and discount system is not implemented.
- Automated unit/integration tests are not included.
- Docker support is not included.
- Additional production hardening (rate limiting and security headers) can be added.

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Product Reviews & Ratings
- Coupon & Discount System
